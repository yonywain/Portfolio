### Links to projects

1. [**Maximum Earthquake Magnitude from Regional Seismic Data**](https://yonywain.github.io/earth-Quake-Mag) - Machine-Learning project as part of the John-Bryce data-science training program. This project attempts to predict the potential earthquake intensity of next year using machine-learning basic models such as NNET and Decision tree.  

2. [**Loan Data Exploration**](https://yonywain.github.io/LoanDataAnalysis) - Exploratory data analysis in R as part of the John-Bryce data-science training program. This project tries to find interesting relations between the different explored variables to be potentially used as a basis for constructing a predication/evaluation model.  

3. [**Practical Machine Learning Prediction Assignment**](https://yonywain.github.io/courseraPracticalML) - Machine-Learning project as part of the [Coursera](coursera.org) Practical Machine Learning course by John Hopkins university. The goal of this assignment was to predict the quality of 20 weight lifting exercises using a constructed model based on Weight Lifting Exercises Dataset. 

4. [**NOAA Storm Data-Set**](https://yonywain.github.io/RR-NOAA) -  Product of the Peer-graded Assignment of John Hopkins university Reproducible Research course in [Coursera](coursera.org) website. This assignment shows data exploration and analysis of influence of storm events on the number of Casualties and injuries.  

5. [**Statistical Inference Course Project**](https://yonywain.github.io/EXPDvsCLT) - This report is a key requirement/assignment of the Statistical Inference Course by Johns-Hopkins University. It consists of two parts: A simulation exercise and a basic inferential data analysis.
